# Draggable-Sheep
Allows you to drag the sheep anywhere on a level

## Installation
### Download Assembly-CSharp file
Put the Assembly-CSharp file in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\HSH Farmageddon\Home Sheep Home Farmageddon Party Edition_Data\Managed` or where ever Home Sheep Home is stored

Note: This will overwrite any edits you have done in Assembly-CSharp before

### Edit Assembly-CSharp directly
This is not that easy since the devs left a bunch of errors in the code but here is the instructions anyway

Copy the code in `source code/Sheep.cs` and replace the entire contents of the Sheep file in Assembly-CSharp with it
